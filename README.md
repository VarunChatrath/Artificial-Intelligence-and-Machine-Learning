# üß† Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my practical projects and experiments in **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and **Time Series Forecasting**.  
All projects are implemented in Python using libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Statsmodels**, **Prophet**, and **TensorFlow/Keras**.

## üìà Featured Projects

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis  
**Goal:** Forecast the future stock price of Bajaj Finance using historical VWAP data.  
**Techniques Used:**
- Data cleaning and feature engineering (rolling means, standard deviations)
- **ARIMA** and **SARIMAX** models for classical forecasting  
- **Prophet** model for trend and seasonality analysis  
- Visualization of actual vs. forecasted prices  
- Performance metrics: MAE, RMSE  

**Result:**  
Prophet and SARIMAX captured clear yearly seasonality, producing stable forecasts of future VWAP trends.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Airline Price Prediction  
**Goal:** Predict airline ticket prices based on features like airline type, source, destination, stops, and duration.  
**Techniques Used:**
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, label encoding, feature scaling)  
- Model training using **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBoost**  
- Feature importance analysis to identify major cost factors  
- Model evaluation using **R¬≤**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**

**Result:**  
Achieved a strong predictive model with interpretable feature importance (duration, airline, and total stops were key drivers).
